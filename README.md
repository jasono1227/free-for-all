 # Game usage
 
  One of the main reasons why video games are so controversal is because of how much people use it. For example, *someone could play for about two hours and think its a lot, but someone on the other hand could think thats a fraction of what they play*. Therefor, usage on vidoeo games can be very controversal depending on who you ask.

  Some people even think video games can cause **violence** and **agression**. Everyone reacts to video games in different ways. Personally, ive been playing video games ever since i can remember and im no where near a violent or aggresive person.
