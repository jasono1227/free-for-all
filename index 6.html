<h1>Game Usage</h1>

<p> One of the main reasons why video games are so controversal is because of how much people use it. For example, *someone could play for about two hours and think its a lot, but someone on the other hand could think thats a fraction of what they play*. Therefor, usage on vidoeo games can be very controversal depending on who you ask.</p>

<p>Some people even think video games can cause <strong>**violence**</strong> and <strong>**agression**</strong>. Everyone reacts to video games in different ways. Personally, ive been playing video games ever since i can remember and im no where near a violent or aggresive person.

<p>On <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135917891000073X">sciencedirect.com</a> it states <em>"Experimental research has shown that playing violent video games produces higher levels of aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and aggressive behavior (in the short-term) than non-violent video games.</em> On the other hand, <a href="http://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1079&context=jepson-faculty-publications">Scholarshipmond.edu</a> says the total oposite. It states States <em>"Studies show that a child playing a violent video game does not necessarily increase the 
    likelihood that he or she will engage in real violence. Americans need to stop blaming something
    other than our own behaviors and ideologies for societal violence, especially gun violence.</em>  </p>
    <p> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135917891000073X/">sciencedirect.com </a> says games such as:

       <p>Can possibly cause issues.I play all these games almost every single day, and ive never even had thoughts of violnce or agression.  </p>
